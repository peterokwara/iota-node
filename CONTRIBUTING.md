# Contributing

The primary branch that will be built and deployed is the `master` branch. This branch should always build, lint and all tests should successfully execute.

Code can only be merged to the `master` branch using a PR, once the PR has been reviewed and any changes made it will be merged.

## New Tasks

When picking up a `new` task to work on you should create a branch with a `feature` prefix, always include the task number and an abbreviated version of it's title.

e.g. If the task is titled `1.0 Create a README file for the repo` the branch would be something like `feature/1_0_Create_README`

## Bug Fixes

When picking up a `fix` task to work on you should create a branch with a `fix` prefix, always include the task number and an abbreviated version of it's title.

e.g. If the bug fix is titled `4.3 Calling API returns undefined` the branch would be something like `fix/4_3_Calling_API`

## Tests

Where relevant you should create unit tests to support your code.
